RGB LED Rainbow Effect on Raspberry Pi Pico

This project creates a rainbow effect on an RGB LED strip using PWM control with a Raspberry Pi Pico. It cycles through colors smoothly using HSV to RGB conversion.

ðŸ›  Hardware Requirements

Raspberry Pi Pico

12V 5050 RGB LED strip

IRLZ34N MOSFETs (x3, one per color channel)

12V power supply

Jumper wires

ðŸ“Œ Wiring Diagram

LED Strip

Pi Pico (GPIO)

GP19

Gate 2

GP16

Gate 3

Note: The MOSFET drain connects to the LED strip, and the source goes to ground.

ðŸ’¾ Software Setup

Install MicroPython on your Raspberry Pi Pico.

Use Thonny IDE or another MicroPython-compatible editor.

Copy the provided main.py script to your Pico.

ðŸ“œ Code Overview

Uses PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) to control LED brightness.

Converts HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) to RGB.

Cycles through colors smoothly for a rainbow effect.

ðŸš€ Running the Code

Save the script as main.py on the Pico.

Restart the board, and the rainbow effect should begin.

ðŸŽ¨ Adjusting Brightness

Modify the brightness factor in the script:

BRIGHTNESS = 0.5  # Set between 0.0 (off) and 1.0 (full brightness)

ðŸ›  Troubleshooting

One color not working? Check wiring & GPIO assignments.

Dim output? Verify MOSFETs and 12V power supply.

No color change? Ensure the script is running without errors.

Enjoy your rainbow LED effect! ðŸŒˆâœ¨
